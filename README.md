# Flask & Pony ORM temeplate

This repository contains a very simple template for setting up a Python
web application that uses Flask and Pony ORM. Simply rename the ``your_project/``
directory and ``your_project_config.py`` to fit your project name and also
adjust the module name in ``your_project/config.py`` to get started.
